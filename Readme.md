It appears https://github.com/iospirit/NSTimeZone-ISCLLocation/ works to determine the location of the time zone city,
but the particular sunrise/sunset library that then uses that location doesn't appear to work as it says it would 

This doesn't really get you further on the *notification* front...but my use for sunrise/sunset was more on the 
circadian front.
